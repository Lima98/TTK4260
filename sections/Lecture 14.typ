= Validity of a model

#definition("Internal validity")[
  does the model include all the important inputs that affect the output?
]

#definition("External validity")[
  are the results generisable to other situations or groups?
]

#definition("Construct validity")[
  does the model measure what it is supposed to measure?
]

#definition("Population validity")[
  can the results be generalized to different group of people?
]

#example("Partner 1")[
  I would like to make a potential partner fall in love with me, but I don’t know how to do it. I then ask for advice from my three nephews, who are 4, 5, and 6 years old. They tell me they would fall in love with me if I buy them a bag of potato chips, sing a fairy tale, and dress as a bunny. I follow their advice when approaching my potential partner, but this makes her/him think I am a weirdo. Which type of validity was missing in my model of “how to approach people”?
]

#example("Partner 2")[
  I would like to make a potential partner fall in love with me, but I don’t know how to do it. I then ask for advice from my three nephews, who are 4, 5, and 6 years old. They tell me they would fall in love with me if I buy them a bag of potato chips, sing a fairy tale, and dress as a bunny.

The rest of the chapter handled things regarding splitting in training test and validation data sets.
