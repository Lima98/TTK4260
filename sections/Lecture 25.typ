= ANN/CNN

Artificial Nerual Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are two types of neural networks used in machine learning and deep learning. They are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data.

*Universal approximation theorem:* A feed forward neural network with a linear output layer and at least one hidden layer with any "squashing" activation function can
approximate any continuous function. \
However, no guarantee on the learnability of the function primarily due to:
- finding global minima
- due to over fitting
